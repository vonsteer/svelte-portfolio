# svelte-portfolio

Testing out the capabilities of svelte and sapper for static site generation. Alongside, the use of markdown to create project/blog-posts.

Further Steps:
- Update Blog to feature image/description/titles of most recent posts and include pagination, alongside a side bar of the current "recent posts".
- Update Project section, fill it out with specific sections for videos/github links/live demo/related blog posts...
- Fill out About section a bit more
- Figure out what the home section should be, at the same time consider adding dark mode switch (alongside the dark mode preference thing)
- Write first project and blog post about implementing this with svelte/sapper.
- Once done with the above move to 2nd project, svelte-ecommerce-site, for clara :D
